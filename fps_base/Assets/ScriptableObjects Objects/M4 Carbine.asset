  description: "The M4 carbine is a shorter and lighter variant of the M16A2 assault
    rifle. The M4 is a 5.56\xD745mm NATO, air-cooled, direct impingement gas-operated,
    magazine-fed carbine. It has a 14.5 in (370 mm) barrel and a telescoping stock.\r\n\r\nThe
    M4 carbine is extensively used by the United States Armed Forces and is largely
    replacing the M16 rifle in United States Army and United States Marine Corps combat
    units as the primary infantry weapon[9][10] and service rifle.\r\n\r\nThe M4 is
    also capable of mounting the M203 and M320 grenade launchers. The distinctive
    step in its barrel is for mounting the M203 with the standard hardware. The M4
    has semi-automatic and three-round burst firing modes (like the M16A2 and M16A4),
    while the M4A1 has semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes (like the M16A1
    and M16A3)."
